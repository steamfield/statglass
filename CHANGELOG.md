# Changelog

## [0.11.0](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.10.0...v0.11.0) - 2026-11-09

### Added

- The Overview machine header shows load averages (1, 5, 15 min), the thermal state at
  Serious or Critical, and a Network row with copyable local and public addresses, so
  the public address lookup (D-093) also runs while Overview is shown.

### Changed

- Dashboard page headers are pinned to the top of the scrolling page and drag the
  window.
- Overview area charts draw their lines at half the module pages' weight.
- The release DMG asset is `StatGlass.dmg` instead of `StatGlass_aarch64.dmg`.
- The machine header's laptop drawing is redrawn.
- Type sizes, weights, tracking, corner radii and icon strokes come from theme tokens
  in `src/app/styles/theme.css`, so a re-theme no longer edits components. No visual
  change apart from the Disk space map's corner radius (3 px to 4 px).

## [0.10.0](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.8.1...v0.10.0) - 2026-11-08

0.9.0 was tagged but not published; 0.10.0 includes its signing and release changes.

### Added

- Largest folders on the Overview: the five biggest folders worth cleaning up on this
  Mac's startup disk (Xcode build data, simulators, caches, `node_modules`, models,
  Downloads and so on), from a report you run from the card. The last report is kept
  with its age and a Re-run button; a row shows the folder in Finder (D-132).
- Containers on the Overview, when Docker monitoring is on: the five containers that
  peaked highest over the time range, by CPU or memory, each linking to its page.
- Other hosts on the Overview, once a remote host is saved: each host's live CPU and
  memory or its connection state; a row switches the dashboard to that host.
- An Overview cards menu in the Overview header to hide and show cards. The choice is
  saved.

### Changed

- Releases are signed with a Developer ID under the hardened runtime and notarized by
  Apple, so the DMG opens without approving it in System Settings (D-131). 0.8.1 was
  Developer ID signed without notarization.
- A pushed version tag builds, signs, notarizes and drafts the release on GitHub's
  standard macOS runner; `scripts/release.sh cut` and `publish` drive it.

## [0.8.1](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.7.0...v0.8.1) - 2026-11-08

0.8.0 was tagged but not published; 0.8.1 includes its changes, with Battery, Events and
Apps flowing into the Overview's card grid instead of a separate row that left gaps.

### Added

- Overview cards chart their module's history over the dashboard's time range, with the
  range control in the Overview header (D-129).
- A second Overview row: Battery (charge over the range, time remaining, health, cycles,
  battery power), Events (detector events in the range, each opening Timeline on that
  moment) and Apps (top apps by CPU, memory, GPU or energy over the range) (D-130).

### Changed

- Overview cards put the live reading in the header and three or four facts under the
  chart; the ring gauges and bars are gone. Memory pressure warnings show as a header chip.
- Network and Disk list upload or read first, matching their charts.
- The popover and the Battery page share one wording for time remaining and time to full.
- Each module page's lead chart is defined once and shared with its Overview card.

## [0.7.0](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.6.2...v0.7.0) - 2026-11-07

0.6.2 was tagged but not published; 0.7.0 includes its changes.

### Removed

- The battery hours view and its `battery_hours` command; Battery's range history
  replaced it.

### Changed

- Timeline lanes default to °F before settings load, like the rest of the app.
- History commands reject an empty time range (start not before end). Four commands that
  accepted one (usage series, usage by app, network by app, series stats) now refuse it.
- Charts and tables stop showing the previous answer once what they show changes: another
  container's history, or a longer or shorter window.
- A failed history reset or history clear no longer leaves its button stuck.
- Keyboard focus holds row order on every live table (Processes, Network apps, Interfaces,
  cgroups, Disk processes, Containers and the per-app usage cards); the usage cards also
  hold on hover. A mouse click no longer freezes order once the pointer leaves.
- Container project groups come from the table's grouping model; markup, collapse and
  `?collapsed=` are unchanged.
- Host, update and cleanup confirmations no longer close on an outside click or Escape
  while their action runs.
- Module absence text names the actual host ("this host", a remote host's name) instead
  of "this Mac", and says when a module isn't in this edition.
- One crosshair look on every chart; resolution labels read the same everywhere
  ("10 s avg"), and container clocks no longer follow the system locale.
- The selected range in network and disk bars uses the shared selection veil.
- Disk I/O x ticks end at "now" and follow the shared axis rule; popover network bars
  stop rescaling every second.
- Container comparison gap bands and history details use Rust's coverage labels; points
  inside a collection or metrics gap no longer count as measured. A container whose stats
  read fails only breaks its own line; the engine total no longer repeats stale values for
  containers it couldn't measure, and History details explains the gap. Waking the Mac from
  sleep no longer records a clock change.
- Docker history stays readable however many interruptions a container records (the
  history database upgrades to schema 9 on first launch).
- The Timeline range control and Containers' history toolbar share one control; the
  Docker popover card uses the module card shell.
- Chart descriptions for screen readers change at most every 10 seconds instead of every
  tick, and heat-matrix descriptions spell out their resolution ("15-minute average").
- "Show as table" for Timeline lanes and container comparisons is one table: oldest
  first, min, avg and max in their own sortable columns, gap rows last, and times with
  seconds when buckets are shorter than a minute.
- The popover GPU stream shows its ceiling and window labels like CPU.
- Disk processes search matches PIDs and ports by their leading digits, like Processes;
  a PID substring ("40" for 1840) no longer matches.
- Informational lines stop announcing as alerts; status and error lines share one size.
- Module history charts share one y-axis treatment (ticks in the gutter) and five x ticks.
  Swap and Used memory gain gutter ticks in place of the corner label, the battery chart
  gains a percent grid and a live label, and Swap gains a selection summary.
- Chart labels share one span wording ("last 15 minutes" or "selected dates").
- The popover power sparkline stops rescaling every second. Container history fits its axis
  like the comparison chart and gains a 0 tick.

## [0.6.2](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2) - 2026-11-07

### Changed

- Every dashboard table sorts through one shared table layer (TanStack Table), and every
  value column sorts by default. The first click sorts descending, or ascending for text,
  and a second click flips the order. Missing readings sort last in both directions, ties
  keep a stable order, and live tables hold their order while the pointer is over them.
- Containers and storage sort in both directions. The containers page keeps the direction
  in its URL (`&dir=`), and Image, Ports, State and Restarts are sortable.
- Remainder rows (Other apps, protocol overhead, N others, smaller items, unaccounted
  space) stay below the sorted rows. Other APFS volumes in the Disk space view sort among
  the folders.

### Added

- The Interfaces, Volumes, Disk space, Largest files and Disk processes tables are
  sortable. Disk processes sort the full list before the top-10 cut and search.

## [0.6.1](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.5.0...v0.6.1) - 2026-11-04

0.6.0 was tagged but not published: its build dropped a list's data too early, so
Back from a container's detail lost the list's scroll position. 0.6.1 is the same
release with that fixed.

### Changed

- StatGlass uses far less memory. The popover no longer makes the WebKit GPU process
  hold about 250 MB while it is open: the whole app measured about 170 MB with the
  popover open, from about 420 MB. A closed dashboard is released after 10 seconds
  instead of 5 minutes, so closing it brings the app back to about 170 MB within
  seconds instead of holding 450 MB for 5 minutes. History the dashboard no longer
  shows is dropped after 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes, and history reads keep
  fewer database connections open.

### Added

- `statglass` commands accept a local date and time for `--from` and `--to`
  (`2026-11-03 15:00`, or `2026-11-03` for midnight) in this Mac's timezone.
- `statglass events --summary` counts a range's events per kind, with the processes
  named most often and a count per day.
- `statglass history` reports the width of each point slot and prints a "no data"
  row for empty slots.

### Fixed

- A remote host's last minutes not yet synced are labelled not synced instead of no
  data.
- A mistyped series label (`disk.read{dev=disk9}`) is an error with the closest
  stored series suggested, instead of an empty answer.
- Text output dates every time when a range reaches past today, and `top` says
  whether it shows average CPU or peak memory.

## [0.5.0](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0) - 2026-11-03

### Added

- A bundled, read-only `statglass` command-line tool for agents and scripts. It
  answers `hosts`, `now`, `metrics`, `history`, `events` and `top` for this Mac and
  remote hosts, with JSON, agent and human output, an error envelope with a next step
  and stable exit codes, `schema` for JSON Schemas, `doctor`, and `skill install`.
  It asks the running app over an owner-only socket and never writes.
- Settings → Command line: an "Allow command-line access" toggle (on by default),
  installing or repairing the `~/.local/bin/statglass` link, and the skill install
  command.

## [0.4.1](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1) - 2026-11-03

### Fixed

- The Linux agent's memory stays bounded on hosts that start many short-lived
  processes while a dashboard is open. Recent usage buckets leave memory once they are
  saved, and saved container buckets no longer stay for the full hour. Before, the
  agent could exceed its service memory limit and be killed by systemd-oomd.

## [0.4.0](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/compare/v0.3.2...v0.4.0) - 2026-11-03

### Changed

- Kelvo is renamed to StatGlass. The app, Linux agent, bundle identifier, data and
  log paths, services and release files use the new name. StatGlass installs beside
  Kelvo, does not import its settings or history, and does not replace it through the
  updater.

### Fixed

- A remote host that fails to connect shows a notice with Retry connection, Open
  Hosts and diagnostics, and dashboard render errors keep the sidebar with retry and
  host navigation.
- A never-connected host shows Connecting and keeps its charts empty until real
  samples arrive, instead of reporting a 0 s cadence.
- A remote Mac with a locked or idle display keeps streaming to the controller. The
  controller applied the remote display-idle flag to its own stream delivery.

## [0.3.2](https://github.com/steamfield/kelvo/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2) - 2026-11-01

### Added

- Each host on the Hosts page shows the Kelvo version it runs and, when it is
  behind, the version this Mac can install, with a link to the release notes. An
  offline host shows the version it last reported.
- When hosts are behind this Mac, the Hosts sidebar entry shows a count and
  dashboard pages show a dismissible notice linking to Hosts. If this Mac has its
  own update pending, the notice asks to update this Mac first.
- Update all pushes the update to every reachable Linux host in turn, after a
  confirmation that lists them, and reports one result list.

### Fixed

- A host whose Kelvo version is too old to connect now shows its version and can
  be updated from its row.
- Dashboard pages animate in section by section again.

## [0.3.1](https://github.com/tryopendata/kelvo/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1) - 2026-10-30

### Fixed

- Recorded app usage no longer stores per-process detail for idle processes, which
  made history grow by roughly 80 MB a day. Under a small size limit that growth
  trimmed all older history, including resource charts, back to the last day.
  Processes are kept when they use at least 0.1% of a CPU core, any GPU, or at
  least 100 MB of RAM. App totals still include every process.
- When history is over the size limit, Kelvo now removes the oldest process
  details and recorded app usage first, and trims resource chart history only if
  that is not enough.

### Changed

- Reduced live-chart animation work by removing forced layout reads and keeping
  chart motion on separate drawing layers. Sampling and history detail are unchanged.
- Reused app identity lookups within each historical usage bucket, reducing
  repeated database work for helper processes.

## [0.3.0](https://github.com/tryopendata/kelvo/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0) - 2026-10-26

### Added

- Automatic installation of signed releases on Macs and Linux hosts, with
  per-host controls and update results. Macs wait until interactive windows are
  closed; Linux agents update independently through systemd.
- Timeline range selection, animated zoom and Back navigation, shared with module
  charts, plus focused event annotations.
- Recorded app usage for historical ranges, with top-ten app groups, expandable
  process details and comparison with the previous interval. Groups can be sorted
  by CPU, GPU, RAM, estimated CPU power or network usage.
- Saved compact popover cards, individual collapse controls and Collapse all /
  Expand all. The popover resizes to fit its content.

### Changed

- Stored app attribution and coverage alongside resource history, with older
  intervals kept at progressively coarser resolution. App attribution starts
  recording after the upgrade; earlier unrecorded app usage is unavailable.
- Raised the default history size limit to 750 MB. Existing valid saved limits
  are preserved; retention still depends on recorded activity and the size cap.

### Fixed

- Temperature defaults now follow macOS regional preferences while preserving
  saved choices. Battery history respects the module toggle, and unavailable
  Battery routes return to a supported page. ([#1](https://github.com/tryopendata/kelvo/issues/1))
- Memory pressure, usage and swap sections now use the full content width.
- Short and ongoing pauses no longer cover charts with prominent captions;
  pause details remain available on hover and keyboard focus.
- Historical selections retain their dates as live data arrives, recover after
  failed reads, and survive returning from container details.

## [0.2.0](https://github.com/tryopendata/kelvo/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0) - 2026-10-25

### Added

- Linux host monitoring over SSH, with bundled x86_64 and aarch64 agents, systemd
  installation, updates, removal and identity re-pairing.
- Linux CPU, memory, disk, network, hardware sensor, battery and power collectors
  where available, plus cgroup service and container monitoring.
- Remote per-app history and disk space reports.
- Rolling and fixed date ranges across module charts, with selection summaries.
- On-demand disk space reports with a drillable treemap.
- Per-app power draw lines and thermal zone history.

### Fixed

- Updated TLS certificate verification, Tokio, Vite and the test DOM dependency
  to resolve dependency audit findings.

- Remote feed replacement, reconnects after sleep, backoff and agent restarts.
- Loading stored remote history into live charts and preserving disk selections
  through process navigation.
- Linux agent memory accounting, stable sensor naming and counter reset handling.
- Repeated rendering in power, container and app usage views.
- Hidden volume heading layout and accessibility coverage.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/tryopendata/kelvo/releases/tag/v0.1.0) - 2026-10-16

- First downloadable Apple Silicon release for macOS 26 or later.
- CPU, GPU, memory, power, sensors, network, disk, battery and process monitoring.
- Local history, Timeline, heatmaps, CSV export and alerts.
- Optional local Docker and remote Mac monitoring.
- Ad-hoc-signed DMG and signature-verified in-app updates.
