StatGlass runs on Apple Silicon Macs (M1 or newer) with macOS 26 or newer.

## Install the app

1. [Download StatGlass](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/releases/latest/download/StatGlass_aarch64.dmg). The link always fetches the newest release; its notes are on [GitHub](https://github.com/steamfield/statglass/releases/latest).
2. Open the DMG and drag StatGlass into Applications.
3. Eject the DMG, then open StatGlass from Applications.

StatGlass is signed with a Developer ID and notarized by Apple, so macOS only asks you to confirm opening an app downloaded from the internet.

StatGlass appears in the menu bar and asks you to choose a menu bar style. [The menu bar and windows](/docs/menu-bar-and-windows) explains the choices.

> [!NOTE]
> StatGlass was called Kelvo before 0.4.0 and installs as a separate app. Kelvo does not update to it, and its settings and history are not imported. Quit Kelvo and stop its remote agents before switching, then install StatGlass on each host and add the hosts again.

## Build from source

Install the Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`), [Rust](https://rustup.rs) and [Bun](https://bun.sh), then:

```sh title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/steamfield/statglass.git
cd statglass
scripts/install.sh
```

Run from a checkout, the script builds that checkout as it is and doesn't pull.

## Uninstall

Quit StatGlass from its menu bar item, then delete the app, its data and the source. The DMG installs into `/Applications` and the source installer into `~/Applications`; the first line removes whichever you have:

```sh title="Terminal"
rm -rf /Applications/StatGlass.app ~/Applications/StatGlass.app
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.tryopendata.statglass ~/Library/Logs/com.tryopendata.statglass
rm -rf ~/.statglass
```

[Updates](/docs/updates) covers keeping an installed copy current.
